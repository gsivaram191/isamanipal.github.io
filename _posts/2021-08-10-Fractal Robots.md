title: Fractal Robots 
---
<p>A fractal is anything which has a substantial measure of exact self-resemblance that is any part of its body will be alike to the whole object.<p/>
<p>Fractal Robots are basically cubic structure robots controlled by computers to reconfigure themselves into objects of different shapes.<p/>
<p>They are normally used to build buildings, in medical operations, research laboratories and so on replacing human labor.
