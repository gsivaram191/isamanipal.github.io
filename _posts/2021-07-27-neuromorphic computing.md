title: Neuromorphic Computing 
---
<p>What is neuromorphic computing?<p/>
<p>How it is transforming AI research?<p/>
<p>With the current generation largely concerned with sensing and perception such as deep learning , the coming generation will extend AI into area that corresponds to human cognition.<p/>
<p>With the brain chip , neuromorphic computing promises an AI revolution.<p/>
