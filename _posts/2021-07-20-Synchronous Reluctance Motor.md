Title : Synchronous Reluctance Motors
---
<p>A Synchronous Reluctance Motor( SynRM motor), is a type of AC motor that has
no windings or magnets on the rotor.<p/>
<p>The motor runs at synchronous speed because of the magnetic locking between the magnetic fields of the stator and rotor.
The rotor has no windings or magnets, it has electric steel plates stacked together to make what can be called a
rotor package.<p/>
<p>It has been such a great alternative that even Tesla's model 3 uses this kind of motor.<p/>
